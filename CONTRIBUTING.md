The pull request opens with a template loaded. Fill out all fields that are relevant.

The `PR` should include following information:
* A descriptive **title** on what changed.
* A detailed **description** of changes.
* If you made changes to the UI please add a **screenshot** or **video** as well.
* If there is a related issue please add a **reference to the issue**. If not, create one beforehand and link it.
* If your PR is still in progress mark it as **Draft**.

### Checks, Tests & Documentation

Request a review from @jhoogstraat (me, the author)

Once you submit the `PR` GitHub will run a couple of actions which run tests and `SwiftLint` (this can take a couple of minutes). Should a test fail, it cannot be merged until tests succeed.

Make sure to resolve all merge-conflicts otherwise the `PR` cannot be merged.

> **Important**: make sure your code is well documented so others can interact with your code easily!
